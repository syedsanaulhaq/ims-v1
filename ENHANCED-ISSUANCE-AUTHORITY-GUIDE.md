# Enhanced Stock Issuance Processing - Authority Control

## Overview
The stock issuance processing system has been enhanced with complete authority control, allowing you to check inventory quantities and make informed decisions about whether to issue each item, even after they've been approved.

## Key Authority Features

### 1. **Real-Time Inventory Checking**
- **Current Stock Display**: See exact inventory levels for each approved item
- **Stock Status Indicators**:
  - ‚úÖ **Sufficient**: Green badge - enough stock available for full issuance
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Insufficient**: Yellow badge - partial stock available
  - ‚ùå **Out of Stock**: Red badge - no stock available
  - üîÆ **Custom Item**: Purple badge - custom items (no stock checking needed)

### 2. **Individual Item Authority Control**
- **Approve for Issuance**: You can approve each item individually after reviewing stock
- **Reject for Issuance**: Authority to reject items even if they were previously approved
- **Quantity Adjustment**: Can issue partial quantities based on available stock
- **Reset Decisions**: Can change your mind and reset item decisions

### 3. **Smart Decision Support**
- **Stock Warnings**: Automatic alerts for insufficient or out-of-stock items
- **Maximum Quantity Limits**: Input fields automatically limited to available stock
- **Authority Notifications**: Clear guidance on your decision-making power
- **Rejection Reasons**: Must provide reasons when rejecting items for audit trail

## How It Works

### Step 1: Request Selection
- Select an approved request from the list
- System automatically fetches current stock levels for all items

### Step 2: Item-by-Item Review
For each item, you see:
- **Item Details**: Name, type (inventory/custom)
- **Quantities**: Approved quantity vs. current stock
- **Stock Status**: Visual indicator of stock availability
- **Warnings**: Alerts for stock issues

### Step 3: Authority Decisions
For each item, you can:
- **Approve for Issue**: ‚úÖ Item will be issued (adjust quantity if needed)
- **Reject for Issue**: ‚ùå Item will not be issued (must provide reason)
- **Reset Decision**: üîÑ Change your mind and reconsider

### Step 4: Process Issuance
- Review summary of approved/rejected items
- Only approved items will be processed
- Complete audit trail maintained

## Authority Control Scenarios

- **Your Authority**: Can approve full quantity or adjust as needed
- **Action**: ‚úÖ Approve for issuance

### Scenario 2: Insufficient Stock

  - Adjust quantity based on priority

### Scenario 3: Out of Stock

- **Action**: ‚ùå Reject with reason for audit

### Scenario 4: Custom Items
- **Situation**: Custom item already approved
- **Your Authority**: No stock checking needed, proceed with issuance
- **Action**: ‚úÖ Approve for issuance (no inventory impact)
