### 2. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Manager Forwarding
1. Login as `manager1`
2. Go to "Approval Manager"
3. See pending approval ISS-2024-001
4. Forward to director1 with high priority
5. Check approval history

#### Scenario B: Director Final Approval
1. Login as `director1`
2. See forwarded approval from manager1
3. Approve with "Final Approval" checkbox
4. Verify status changes to APPROVED

#### Scenario C: Rejection Workflow
1. Login as `approver1`
2. See pending approval ISS-2024-002
3. Reject with detailed reason
4. Check complete audit trail

### 3. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check approval status
SELECT * FROM View_IssuanceApprovalStatus;

-- Check pending forwards
SELECT * FROM IssuanceApprovalForwards WHERE IsActive = 1;

-- Check approval history
SELECT * FROM IssuanceApprovalHistory ORDER BY ActionDate DESC;
```
