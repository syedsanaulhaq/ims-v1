# Custom Items Implementation - Complete

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The custom items functionality has been successfully implemented and committed. This allows users to add items that are not in the inventory system to their stock issuance requests.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Database Schema Changes**
   - Added `item_type` column (inventory/custom)
   - Added `custom_item_name` column for custom items
   - Made `item_master_id` nullable for custom items
   - Added constraint to ensure data integrity

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - **StockIssuance.tsx**: Added custom items form section
   - **ApprovalManagement.tsx**: Added item type badges (Inventory/Custom)
   - Removed quantity displays from inventory selection for security
   - Custom items show as green badges, inventory items as blue badges

3. **Key Features**
   - Custom items only require name and quantity
   - No price tracking for custom items
   - Visual distinction between inventory and custom items
   - Easy revert capability

## 🔄 Easy Revert Instructions
