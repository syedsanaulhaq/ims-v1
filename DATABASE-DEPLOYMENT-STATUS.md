-- Status: ✅ Ready for production use
-- Features: All enhanced views and functions deployed
```

### **Option 2: Fresh Database Deployment**
If deploying to a new server, run these scripts in order:

```bash
# 1. Core schema
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER -d NEW_DATABASE -i "core-schema.sql"

# 2. Enhanced organizational functions
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER -d NEW_DATABASE -i "create-name-conversion-functions.sql"

# 3. Enhanced views  
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER -d NEW_DATABASE -i "update-view-tenders-with-names.sql"

# 4. Sample data (optional)
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER -d NEW_DATABASE -i "sample-data.sql"
```
