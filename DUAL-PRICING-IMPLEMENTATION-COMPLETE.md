## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Individual Pricing Mode (Default)**
1. User selects "Individual Item Pricing"
2. For each item with quantity > 0, a unit price field appears
3. System calculates: `total_item_amount = quantity × unit_price`
4. All items must have valid unit prices to proceed

### **Total Amount Distribution Mode**
1. User selects "Total Amount Distribution"
2. User enters single total amount for entire delivery
3. System distributes amount across items based on quantity ratios
4. Formula: `item_amount = total_amount × (item_qty / total_qty)`

### **Enhanced Display**
- 📊 Pricing method clearly displayed for each delivery
- 💰 Individual item prices and totals shown
- 🧮 Automatic total calculation for all deliveries
- 🎨 Color-coded pricing information sections

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run Database Function Updates:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute this file:
   update-delivery-function-with-pricing.sql
   ```

2. **Test the Implementation:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/transaction-manager`
   - Select a tender
   - Create new delivery and test both pricing modes
   - Verify pricing information displays correctly

3. **Validation Points:**
   - Individual pricing: All items must have unit prices
   - Total pricing: Total amount must be > 0
   - Database constraints ensure data integrity
   - Frontend validation prevents invalid submissions

## ✨ **Key Features**

- 🔄 **Dual Mode Support**: Seamless switching between pricing methods
- 📊 **Automatic Calculations**: No manual math required
- 🛡️ **Data Validation**: Comprehensive client and server-side validation
- 🎨 **Enhanced UI**: Clear visual distinction between pricing modes
- 💾 **Database Integrity**: Constraints ensure consistent data
- 📈 **Reporting Ready**: All pricing data captured for reporting

## 🎉 **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The dual pricing mode is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users can choose between:
- ○ **Individual Item Pricing** (Current way) - Enter price per item
- ○ **Total Amount Distribution** (New way) - Enter total amount, system distributes

All changes are backward compatible and existing deliveries will default to individual pricing mode.
